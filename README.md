# React Playground

Just some mini projects for me to understand react a bit better.

1. Memory
1. Tic Tac Toe
1. Shopping List/ToDo List

If you want to try-out the apps just build the project and run the dev server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173/ and have fun!
